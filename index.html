              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">Using manual breaks to get four equal spaced classes of 0.25 of the proportion of residents who are rural in Ohio, shows that there are higher proportions of rural residents in southern and north western Ohio. The north east and south west have lower proportions of rural residents. Ohio is known for having large amounts of rural residents except in its major cities of Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. This helps explain some of the distribution that a lot of the state has higher proportions of rural residents. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">When examining the proportional symbol map of the number of residents under the age of 5 years old for each major city, it is clear to see that this follows a pattern of the cities with the largest populations. New York, NY clearly has the largest number of residents under the age of 5, followed by very large cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. The major cities of Texas including Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas also register as having large number of residents under the age of 5 compared to the other major cities across the US. It is worth noting that this is a raw count of the number of residents under the age of 5 per the census data so it makes sense that it matches along with the population size of major cities.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This bivariate map does not show any obvious spatial patterns across the zip codes of Iowa, however, there are a lot of zip codes that fall into the "high" range of providers (this does not mean that a lot of providers work in this zip code, it may indicate that the population is fairly small in that region and adding one provider changes the rate dramatically). There is some clumping of high-high in the north east, around the west side of Des Moines and there are three obvious zip codes that fall into the mid-mid category.of the zip codes that had providers, the mid-low zip codes fall around the north west part of Des Moines. And a few zip codes to the south east of Des Moines. There are no zip codes that fall into the low-low category. If a county had a very small count of providers and even one was female, it would change the percentage a lot and may place that county into a different category. Also, if a zip code had so few providers, it would count as zero and would appear on this map as black since you can't have a female percent without a provider.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This map shows the quantile classification of flows of the ferry routes for their average numberr of vehicles and passengers per vessel. The proportional symbols depict the number of trips that leave that terminal each year. Since there are many islands in this region of Alaska it makes sense that there are a lot of ferry terminals/ports that flow between them. The majority of these are around Anchorage and Jeaunu as these are the most populous areas in this region.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The small multiples map shows a similar grouping of low rates of midlevel providers and physicians as well as lower median age for the population around the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. This is not unexpected since cities tend to attract younger individuals.</p>
